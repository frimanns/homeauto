# Contributing to Homeauto

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project documents a modular, Docker-based home automation stack using Home Assistant and MQTT.

## How to Contribute

- 🐛 **Found a bug?** Open an issue with steps to reproduce.
- 📚 **Improved documentation?** Submit a pull request with edits to `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`.
- 🧩 **New integrations?** Fork the repo and add your automation, sensor, or dashboard config under `examples/`.

## Guidelines

- Keep YAML clean and commented
- Use relative paths for portability
- Document any gotchas or platform-specific quirks
- Prefer anonymous MQTT for simplicity unless security is needed

## Versioning

Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`  
Tag milestones with `git tag vX.Y.Z`

Happy automating!
